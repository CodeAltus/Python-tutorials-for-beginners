## Comments
- Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter
- Allows us to explain code
- Starts with a '# '

Example of a comment:
> `# This is a comment`
> 
> `print("Hello world")`

---

## Input
- Allows the user to input something
- Prompt can be used to ask for input
> `print("What is your name?")`
> 
> `name = input()`

or

> `name = input("What is your name? ")`

---

## Operations
- To do calculations

|Operator symbol|What it does|
|---|---|
|+|Addition|
|-|Subtraction|
|*|Multiplication|
|/|Division|
|**|Exponent (power)|
|//|Integer division|
|%|Modulo (gives us the remainder after division)|

## Practice problem
Write a program that asks the user to input a positive dividend and a positive divisor and print out the quotient and remainder

> `Enter dividend: 9`
>
> `Enter divisor: 2`
>
> `The quotient is 4`
>
> `The remainder is 1`
